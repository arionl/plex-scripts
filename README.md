Plex Scripts
============

This is a collection of a few Plex scripts I've found useful. Some of them are from pieces I found online (i.e. a
Reddit thread) and others are ones I've hacked together.

`clean-collections.py` - this script removes extraneous "Collections" from a library.

`keybase-api.py` - this is a Flask script that sends Plex events, via a webhook configured in 
[Tautulli](https://tautulli.com/), to a [KeyBase](https://keybase.io/Keybase) Teams chat channel.
